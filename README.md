# Spark-Foundation-Tasks
The Spark Foundation internship, I gained hands-on experience in Python, Power BI, and Excel for project-based learning. It enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills while making a meaningful impact. Grateful for the guidance and mentorship received. Excited to pursue my passion in data analytics.
